# Webcrawler
Designed to crawl a website called 'Fakebook' that was developed for Northeastern's networking courses.  Traverses the site's pages using BFS, searching for 'secret flags'.  Implemented in Python.  For educational purposes, all HTTP request strings and cookie handling were written manually, without using libraries like urllib, httplib, and cookielib.  A username and password are required to access the site.
